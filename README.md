##exc_to_pt

###Description:
Python script that utilizes the ##Python ArcPy## library to create a project file gdb, loop through all project .xlsx files and sheets (tables) in the given directory path, and converts all relevant tables to feature classes in the new project gdb.

###Preparation:
1. Only tables (sheets) with both "Lat" and "Lon" field names can be included, otherwise the program will print an error.
2. Insure there are no spaces or strange characters in the sheet names of each excel file. Give each sheet a descriptive name such as "Crash_2015".

###Instructions to run program:
1. Download the exc_to_pt program.
2. Open a command window in the same directory that this script is saved - hold shift and right-click anywhere in the directory, choose 'open command window here'.
3. Type 'python exc_to_pt.py' and Press Enter. - this only works if you have already added the path to your Python directory to the system environment variable path (Windows). If you have not done this, you will need to do so or use an IDE to run this script, such as IDLE or PyCharm, etc. You may also try running it as an executable (double-click).
3. When prompted, enter the path to where your project xlsx files are saved. Press Enter.
4. When prompted, enter the name of your project file geodatabase, including the .gdb file extension. Press Enter.
5. If the program is running and completes successfully, you should see several print statements as the program is running, and then a print statement that reads 'PROGRAM COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY'. Navigate to your project path and view the gdb and featureclasses to make sure everything is good to go.
