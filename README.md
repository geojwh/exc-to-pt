## exc-to-pt

### Description:
A Python script that utilizes the **ArcPy** package to create a project file gdb, loop through all project .xlsx files and sheets (tables) within a given directory, and convert all relevant tables to feature classes in the new project gdb.

### Preparation:
1. Only tables (sheets) with both "Lat" and "Lon" field names can be included, otherwise the program will print an error.
2. It is a good habit to format the fields in your dataset (ie. date, number with decimal places, etc).
3. Ensure there are no spaces or strange characters in the sheet names of each excel file. It is a good habit to give each sheet a descriptive name such as "atx_building_vertices".

### Instructions to run program:
1. Download the exc-to-pt program.
2. Open a command window in the same directory that this script is saved - hold shift and right-click anywhere in the directory, choose 'open command window here'.
3. Type 'python exc-to-pt.py' and Press Enter. - this only works if you have already added the Python directory path to the system environment variable path (Windows). If you have not done this, you need to do so or you need to use an IDE to run this script, such as IDLE or PyCharm, etc. You may also try running it as an executable (double-click).
3. When prompted, enter the path to where your project xlsx files are saved. Press Enter.
4. When prompted, enter the name of your project file geodatabase, including the .gdb file extension. Press Enter.
5. If the program is running and completes successfully, you should see several print statements as the program is running, and then a print statement that reads 'PROGRAM COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY' with the amount of time it took to complete. Navigate to your project path and view the gdb and featureclasses to make sure everything is good to go.
